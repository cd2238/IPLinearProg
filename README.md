## Install
* sudo apt install gfortran lapack-dev doxygen

## compilation
* cd make
* make all
* make all STATUS=debug (for some intermediate results and gdb possibilities)

## TO DO
* Add a more usual formulation for linear programming
* Add sparse matrices management
* Add preprocessing (delete dependent rows,...)
